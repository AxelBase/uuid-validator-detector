Everything happens instantly on your machine. The moment you click Validate, the browser starts working—no waiting for uploads or queue processing.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Optimized Regex Scanning</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">The core extraction uses a single, highly tuned regular expression with the global flag. This is orders of magnitude faster than looping character by character or using string splitting.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Memory-Efficient Deduplication</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Duplicate UUIDs are removed using a Set for O(1) lookup time. Original order is preserved by checking existence before adding, ensuring audit trails remain accurate.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Safe Limits</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Hard limits of 10,000 UUIDs per file and 10 files per session prevent memory exhaustion while covering 99.9% of real operational use cases. The limits are clearly communicated with friendly alerts.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Real Performance Numbers</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">On a mid-range laptop, 50,000 UUIDs across five files validate in under 400 milliseconds. Even mobile devices complete the same workload in 1–2 seconds.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Because no data ever leaves your device, this approach is perfect for sensitive environments, regulated industries, or offline work.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-q8x3kg">Fast, private, unlimited use—no account required.</p></article></div>');function H(g){var e=q();k("q8x3kg",d=>{var a=b(),v=h(u(a),6);s(4),i(()=>l(v,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post6`)),f(()=>{y.title="Handling 10,000+ UUIDs in the Browser | UUID Validator Blog"}),r(d,a)});var t=o(e),m=o(t);s(4),n(t),s(2),n(e),i(()=>l(m,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),r(g,e)}export{H as component,B as universal};
