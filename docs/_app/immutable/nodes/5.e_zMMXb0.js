The RFC 4122 standard defines five official versions, each with a different generation method and intended purpose. This tool validates all of them correctly by examining specific bit patterns in the UUID string.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Version 1: Time-Based UUID</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Version 1 UUIDs combine a high-precision timestamp with the node’s MAC address. They are excellent when you need natural sorting by creation time and very low collision probability without coordination. The timestamp is measured in 100-nanosecond intervals since 1582-10-15 gives them a theoretical lifespan beyond the year 3400 AD.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Version 2: DCE Security UUID</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Version 2 is rarely used today. It extends version 1 by embedding POSIX user and group IDs. Because of privacy concerns and limited adoption, most modern systems avoid it entirely. This validator still recognizes it correctly but flags it as uncommon in practice.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Version 3: Name-Based (MD5)</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Version 3 generates deterministic UUIDs by hashing a namespace identifier and a name using MD5. While reproducible, MD5 is now considered cryptographically broken, so version 3 is discouraged for new designs. The tool identifies these UUIDs and warns when legacy systems still rely on them.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Version 4: Random UUID</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">By far the most widely used today, version 4 UUIDs are generated from cryptographically strong random or pseudorandom numbers. They contain no embedded information, making them ideal for databases, distributed systems, and any scenario requiring high entropy without coordination. This validator treats version 4 as the default safe choice.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Version 5: Name-Based (SHA-1)</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Version 5 is the recommended replacement for version 3. It uses SHA-1 hashing with a namespace and name, producing deterministic but collision-resistant identifiers. It is commonly used for distributed content addressing and schema migrations.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Knowing which version you are dealing with helps diagnose issues in logs, migrations, and replication systems. This client-side validator instantly tells you the exact version and whether the UUID conforms to RFC 4122, all without sending data anywhere.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1tq17n3">Use version 4 for new projects. Use version 5 when deterministic IDs are required.</p></article></div>');function j(h){var e=q();w("1tq17n3",p=>{var a=I(),u=g(v(a),6);t(4),n(()=>l(u,"content",`${d??""}/blog/posts/post1`)),y(()=>{f.title="Understanding UUID Versions 1 through 5 | UUID Validator Blog"}),i(p,a)});var s=r(e),m=r(s);t(4),o(s),t(2),o(e),n(()=>l(m,"href",`${d??""}/blog`)),U(1,e,()=>b,()=>({duration:600})),i(h,e)}export{j as component,S as universal};
