They are buried inside log lines, configuration files, database exports, API responses, and monitoring dashboards. Finding and validating them manually is impossible at scale. This is where batch validation becomes essential.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Why Layout Doesn’t Matter</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">UUIDs can appear anywhere: inside JSON objects, CSV columns, quoted strings, log timestamps, or even concatenated with other data. This tool uses a high-performance regular expression that scans the entire text and extracts every valid RFC 4122 UUID, regardless of surrounding content.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Supported Input Types</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">You can paste raw text directly, or upload multiple files in TXT, CSV, or JSON format. The validator automatically detects and processes all formats without requiring any preprocessing.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Real-World Scenarios</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Developers use batch validation to audit production logs to find malformed IDs before they cause replication failures. Database administrators run it on export dumps before migrations. Security teams scan for leaked UUIDs in public repositories. DevOps engineers verify monitoring dashboards display correct identifiers.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Performance & Limits</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">All processing happens client-side using optimized regex and Set-based deduplication. The tool safely handles up to 10,000 UUIDs per file and 10 files simultaneously, covering the vast majority of operational needs without server costs or privacy risks.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Results are instantly available with full export options, making audit reports and documentation effortless.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1al8b51">Validate thousands of UUIDs in seconds — no backend, no data leaves your browser.</p></article></div>');function B(d){var e=I();y("1al8b51",u=>{var t=D(),f=b(g(t),6);a(4),r(()=>n(f,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post3`)),h(()=>{v.title="Batch Validation: Extracting UUIDs from Logs & Files | UUID Validator Blog"}),o(u,t)});var s=i(e),m=i(s);a(4),l(s),a(2),l(e),r(()=>n(m,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),o(d,e)}export{B as component,T as universal};
